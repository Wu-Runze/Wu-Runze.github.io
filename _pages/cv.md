Short Bio
======
I currently lead User Profiling Group of Fuxi AI Lab, NetEase Inc. My interests cover a wide range of domains like user modeling, personalization, behavior analysis, and AI for novel applications. I have published dozens of top-tier AI conference/journal papers like KDD, AAAI, ICDE, CIKM, TKDE, TKDD, TOIS etc., and served as SPC/PC/reviewer for top-tier conferences and journals.  Our research outcomes have been successfully applied and integrated into many top online games released by NetEase Games.
